#The Product Organizer - Group 26

The Product organizer is a web application oriented toward grocery shoppers. The website is able to store common product information for a specified restaurant and makes sure to warn of certain product availabilities. One of the Product Organizer's main features is a digital grocery lists customizable on the go. 

The aim of our project is to create a quick, simple way for restaurants, grocery stores and their customers to understand product allocation. The main users should be able to rely on the system and decrease time spent cataloguing groceries and what dishes they are able to cook. We want our users to feel like they are saving time.
